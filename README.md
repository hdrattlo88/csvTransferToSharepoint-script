# CSV Data Transfer to Sharepoint List PowerShell Script
PowerShell script to transfer data from csv file to SharePoint List

# What will this script do?
This script will create a local copy of the csv file specified, parse the data, migrate the data into designated SharePoint Online list, and finally, will delete the local copy of the csc file. 

To get this script to work for you, simply change the variables that have been called out with []. I tried to make it as easy as possible.

# Enjoy!!!
